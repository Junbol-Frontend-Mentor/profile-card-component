## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass(SCSS)
- BEM (Block.Element.Modifier)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- GIT/GitHub
- PowerShell (CLI)

### What I learned

Working with SCSS Grid & MediaQueries

```
.container {
  flex: 1 0 auto;

  margin: 0 auto; /* This centers the container horizontally */
}


 &:hover {
      // Correct hover syntax using &
      transform: rotate(360deg); /* Completes a full circle */
    }
Sass(SCSS)  +   BEM (Block.Element.Modifier)

```

### Continued development

I would like to continue studying responsive SCSS specially with Grid + Flexbox and CSS animation, transitions and FX like parallax.
